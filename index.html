        //After material we will need a geometry with some vertices:

        const geometry = new THREE.BufferGeometry().setFromPoints(points);

        //Note that lines are drawn between each consecutive pair of vertices, but not between the first and last (the line is not closed.)
        //Now that we have points for two lines and a material, we can put them together to form a line.

        //All that's left is to add it to the scene and call render.
